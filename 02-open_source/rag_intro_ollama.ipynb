      "java -cp target/<jar_name>-SNAPSHOT.jar:out src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer\n",
      "```\n",

The provided context suggests using `javac` for compilation but typically integrating with build automation systems (like Maven or Gradle) would streamline this process further by including dependency management and packaging steps in one go.\n"
